title: On the Potential of Video Game Narratives in Virtual Reality
description: >
  Two short discussions with some friends led me to conclude that a large part of the potential of VR gaming, namely the virtual reality space as a tool to facilitate narratives, remains largely underutilized.

I do not own a VR headset or anything that closely resemble them in function, but I do agree, like many others, on the potential and power of VR. It pulls the player further into the game, getting rid of the empty space between you and your device. The immersive experience it provides is drastically different than that of normal video games, and such uniqueness would be hard to conquer, other than magical or supernatural means.

Yet a decade, counted with reasonable error tolerance, after the first prototypical headset came into existense, VR is still not as big as a thing it should have been. Despite unarguably being the future, people still can't comfortably afford a VR set. I still don't have the motivation to get a VR set.

I had two discussions recently with two groups of friends, pretty much independent with each other. I believe I know neither the reason nor the solution to the conundrum, but I do think what I concluded is worth a few cents and a blog post of some sort.
